Synthetic biology brings together biology, biotechnology, computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics to create useful genetic tools and platforms. It is also a strategy to help us understand basic biological regulatory mechanisms and complex genetic networks: by designing and building artificial ones, we learn how they work in nature (understanding by building). In this course, you will study the theoretical underpinnings of cutting-edge research in synthetic biology and learn how the development of disruptive technologies, combined with engineering principles, led to the emergence of this new scientific field. You will also learn how basic theory and knowledge of biology can guide the rational design of artificial biological circuits in living cells to accomplish well-defined goals. The goal of the course is to help you acquire essential techniques in synthetic biology, such as designing and constructing genetic parts, devices, modules, and systems, and develop new perspectives and skills that may help you in the future meet the demands of the biotech industry and academia."

            "DESCRIPTION": "Housing, unlike other goods, has its unique characteristics in terms of heterogeneity, durability, spatial fixity, and high purchase price relative to income. These suggest that conventional economic concepts need to be readdressed in order to analyze the microeconomic issues of housing. Besides, a significant number of households own residential properties by borrowing mortgages. A substantial collapse in housing prices might lead to negative equity for those households, and reduce their consumption and investment thereafter. Therefore, the macroeconomic implication of housing market dynamics cannot be overstated. The US subprime mortgage crisis during 2007-09 suggests that a sharp downturn in the housing market can cause negative spillovers to the aggregate economy. The first part of this course focuses on microeconomic issues like housing demand and supply analysis, models of housing market, rationales and effects of government’s housing policies. The second part emphasizes the macroeconomic issues such as the stylized facts on housing market dynamics, causes of housing market fluctuations, and housing market spillovers. Applications to the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2009 and housing markets in Hong Kong and China will also be addressed. The objective of this course is to develop analytical frameworks by which students can address both the microeconomic and macroeconomic issues of housing."

For instance, if the central bank tightens monetary policy by increasing interest rates, the cost of borrowing will rise and it will lower profit for a firm which relies on debt financing. The rising interest rates also lower the investment return for bondholders. If a country devalues its currency or defaults on its sovereign debt, creditors or investors from foreign countries will realize investment loss. This course introduces fundamental concepts of macroeconomic and financial risk management. It focuses on the identification, quantification, and management of various macroeconomic and financial risks. It evaluates and applies different tools and procedures, comprising quantitative measures and qualitative assessment, to measure and manage risk. Problems and challenges that arise in risk management process are also addressed."

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

            "DESCRIPTION": "Atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases, of which the largest component is carbon dioxide, are highly likely to be causing warming of the atmosphere and global climate change. To reduce those emissions, a variety of mitigation measures have been proposed. A measure that has emerged as favored by many jurisdictions is known as cap-and-trade. In this scheme, an overall limit is placed on atmospheric emissions of one or more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Rights to emit portions thereof are assigned to numerous emitters, but these rights are then allowed to be traded among emitters, so that lower-cost emission reducers can abate total emissions with more economic efficiency than higher-cost ones. This course will cover the principles and practice of cap-and-trade and carbon emissions trading."

In addition to these internal governance mechanisms, corporations are also disciplined by external factors such as product-market competition, laws and regulation, and the market for corporate control. This course analyzes how good corporate governance can mitigate incentive and information problems, nurture great leaders, and foster great companies. Through numerous cases and examples, we also show how bad governance can worsen these problems, lead managers to cheat, and cause companies to fall."

            "DESCRIPTION": "This course will focus on three alternative asset classes, namely commodities, trade finance and infrastructures. Commodities have taken an increasing importance due to the growth in emerging markets, issues over fossil fuels vs. renewable energy, the possibility of future inflation and the continuing financial repression on traditional assets. Trade finance, or financing for trade, is used when financing is required by buyers and sellers of physical goods to assist them with the trade cycle funding gap, or as a form of risk mitigation. Originally a bank internal activity, it has gradually muted into an asset class available to non-bank investors. Finally, infrastructure investing has emerged as a successful asset class amid strong demand for infrastructure investments and a deep need for infrastructure capital, also now accessible through various financial products to non-bank investors.  The purpose of this course is to give participants a good understanding and workable knowledge of the techniques that should be part of the toolkit of anyone investing in, trading, hedging, analyzing and/or advising private and institutional clients on these three alternative asset classes. Furthermore, this course will enable the participants to absorb the analytical arguments in the technical publications – the in-house research notes of financial institutions and in practitioner oriented journals – that deal with commodities and their markets, and to apply them."

It demonstrates that far from being isolated, the two areas overlap, and in reality are bonded by political, cultural and ethnic ties. Analysis of historical data provides a vibrant perspective for understanding Southwest China, not as an area at the margins of Chinese and SEA history, but as a vital link in a chain that connects SEA with the worlds of China and Tibet. Emphasis on interconnection highlights a fundamental relationship between both regions, and offers students a framework for understanding the increased presence of China in mainland SEA in recent years.",

Distanced from the state-controlled film industry and often regarded as a counter culture against mainstream ideologies, independent cinema is frequently banned in China and screened abroad at international film festivals. As a symbol of both media democracy and secrecy, it provides us with a unique window to understand the diversified culture and society full of clamorous voices in post-1989 China. This course explores the histories, aesthetics, styles, contents, techniques, and technologies of independent cinema in contemporary China. It will be students-oriented and conducted through forms of seminars and discussions. Unlike traditional courses that are based on uni-directional lectures, readings, exams, and papers in a fixed classroom, this experimental course encourages students to venture outside and engage more with our society. It is a non-conventional, open, and democratic course that puts students in direct contact with our rapidly changing world."

            "DESCRIPTION": "Even in the age of globalization and highly advanced communication and transportation technologies, human beings still belong to different groups, each with its own set of identifying markers and priorities. These human identities and groupings are fundamentally informed by their historical past. This course is an exploration of human society through a historical analysis of the roots of these broad categories that we use to organize ourselves. The first value of “identity and community” examines the formation and changes in basic categories of differences in human society. These categories include ethnic, religious, and linguistic differences that gave rise to varying layers of identities that each individual may possess. Exploring the second value, “contact and conflict,” entails analyzing how these differences in identities caused competition over ideologies and resources. Finally, understanding the value of “justice and resolution” is an investigation of the ways through which human beings have devised ways to resolve conflicts and disputes within and between groups."

            "NAME": "Foundational Texts in the Humanities: The Four Books - Zhu Xi's Reading",
            "DESCRIPTION": "The Four Books include the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean. As the embodiment of the teachings of the ancient sages and worthies of Confucius, Mencius, Zengzi and Zixi, they had long been venerated as sacred texts by Confucian scholars. They, however, did not form an organic set of philosophical treatises until Zhu Xi (1130-1200), the renowned Neo-Confucian great synthesizer in Southern-Song, grouped them together. Apart from giving them the specific format, Zhu also wrote them prefaces and commentaries, highlighting their themes and suggesting how they should be read and understood, as a result of which he produced the Collected Commentaries on the Four Books. Zhu’s commentaries, alongside with the Books upon which they elaborated, were the most widely read and, thus, the most influential Confucian texts from the early 14th Century onward up until the early 20th Century. The significance they had attained in late Imperial China can be compared to that of the Bible in medieval and early modern Europe. Their popularity, of course, had much to do with the fact that they constituted the core of the official curriculum for the Civil Service Examinations during those six centuries. But, what is even more fundamental is that as the fruit of a lifetime search for the ideal personality, Zhu’s Collected Commentaries was indeed a major source of inspiration for generations of Confucian gentlemen whose aspiration was nothing but to become a sage or a worthy. This course will guide students to read carefully through the lines of the Books, as well as those of Zhu’s commentaries, to investigate into the following questions: 1) What actually it was that constituted the Confucian education program of inner-sageliness and outer-kingliness? 2) What were the concrete methods that had been recommended for the achievement of those aims?, and 3) What were the underlying assumptions on which the whole education program was predicated? It is expected that through examining these crucial issues, students will not only appreciate better the essence of the Confucian teachings of learning to become a sage, but also gain a deeper understanding of the philosophy that lies behind: the peculiar metaphysics, philosophical anthropology, ethics, social and political philosophies that characterize the Confucian tradition."

This course is in chronological order, beginning from Republican women to contemporary female immigrants in the age of globalization. The changing images of women on screen went hand in hand with major cinematic movements in history, including the left turn in the 1930s, the rise of animation, socialist filmmaking, model opera film, underground/independent filmmaking, and the cinematic globalization.

Real life experiential learning will be substantiated with laboratory sessions on food technology analysis and classroom lectures on relevant conceptual frameworks to explore critical issues about heritage preservation, tourism development and community revitalization.

The course covers key anthropological concepts such as taboo, pollution, liminality, and dead body politics through both classic and contemporary ethnography. The three fundamental questions we ask throughout this course are: What happens when we die? What impacts does death have on social life? How can we better understand the politics and economy of death? Each question provides key elements of an understanding of the cultures of death and dead bodies. The course therefore aims to teach students to see the politics and economy of death and dead bodies as integral to the variety of cultures of death. It emphasizes an exploration of the power of the state and of capitalism, social relationships, and modern institutions as well as their impact on managing corpses, performing rituals, and regulating grief and mourning in the modern era."

            "DESCRIPTION": "This course offers a social-scientific study of political violence, terrorism, and suicide terrorism in the world, particularly in the Middle East. Suicide terrorism is enigmatic and extraordinarily lethal phenomenon, historically unique, extending over to more than forty countries (including China, US, India, France, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Iraq). The course presents a comparative-theoretical analysis based on real-time close-range investigation of Palestinian terrorism attacks in Israel during the Intifada, focusing on the arena of explosion where the disguised perpetrator and his/her target meet. Exploration of suicide terrorism uses firsthand materials produced by unconventional research methods and hitherto classified sources, revising the current discussion on the strategic logic of suicide terrorism and suggesting original insights on its moral logic. Suicide terrorism's exceptionally coercive as well as subversive impact is explained in terms of its paradoxical nature; especially the peculiar inherent link between aggressor and victim. The course draws from a forthcoming book - The Smile of the Human Bomb."

Contracts and documents concern multi-ethnic areas in Southwest China, and students must possess the ability to read them in the original. Discussions will include not only deep reading of contracts, textual and historical analysis, but also their role as instruments of social control. This course is designed to guide students in creatively using contracts as sources for social history and is not a mere factual and descriptive account of Chinese contracts.",

What are the stories told once and again in Chinese culture? Is it true that each retelling is different? Or do things stay more or less the same despite changes of time? Are there perennial themes that thread through Chinese civilization? Is this a valid question? In this course, we engage these questions by putting examples in Chinese literature and culture from the past and the present into dialogue. Taking a transmedia approach, this course brings in both textual and visual materials from history, literature, and cinema. By juxtaposing materials of relevance from different times and carried by various media, we explore continuities and discontinuities in Chinese culture as well as the possibilities and limits each historical moment offers for cultural transformation."

This is a world which is a product of mobility of people, information and products across physical and virtual boundaries. Languages themselves are changed through migration. Within a context of linguistic diversity, language is central to the organization of institutions, access to information, the exchange of goods and the ability to communicate. Students will investigate how language is used by migrants in areas including health, education, the law and employment. They will explore how language practices are shaped by face-to-face and mediated encounters and by the constraints of political and institutional contexts. Key questions are: What languages and forms of communication get used, when, why and where? What linguistic factors enable and limit access for migrants to services and resources? What are the consequences for migrants?"

In the context of this course, \"technologies\" should be understood as the operations and cooperation of politics, ethics, and religions through which passions for the self and other is formed and expressed. Together, the class investigate the literary transformations and ramifications of two perennial themes - love and the self - in Chinese literature across temporal and generic boundaries. How is \"selfhood\" philosophized, lyricized, and narrated? How is \"love\" represented, assessed, and contested? We examine how one's understanding of subjectivity, imagination of gender and sexuality, and knowledge of historical changes are mediated through diverse \"technologies\" in which explorations of the self and articulations of romantic engagement intertwine."

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

            "DESCRIPTION": "The primary purpose of managerial accounting is to provide superior information to those running a company so that they can make better decisions and more successfully compete for customers, suppliers, employees, and so forth. In short, good managerial accounting is a competitive tool.\n\nBecause a managerial accounting system is (or can be) a competitive tool, the practice of managerial accounting involves innovation, experimentation, diversity, success, and failure as businesses tinker with their managerial accounting systems to create superior information for decision making. Certainly there are “best practices” in managerial accounting; you will learn about them in this course. But remember that a good business is always re-examining its internal information system to see whether the system can be coaxed into providing better, timelier data.\n\nSince the first days of the Industrial Revolution, business owners and managers have generally adopted the best accounting ideas available from other companies and then created their own new accounting system to provide a competitive edge. In fact, a company often regards a good managerial accounting system as a valuable company secret—and rarely discloses its details to the public. In contrast, financial accounting has effectively developed around the world to provide a common reporting platform to the public. The purpose of financial accounting, as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), is to satisfy the needs of outside investors, creditors, and regulators for fair and consistent reports of financial position and operations. Accordingly, all companies are required to apply the same general financial accounting rules so that outsiders can compare financial reports coming from many different companies. These financial accounting rules are established internationally by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in the United States by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).\n\nIn contrast to the rules and regulations surrounding financial accounting, no government regulator or auditor is going to insist that a company implement a good managerial accounting system; the choice of how to collect and use information within a company is part of a company’s competitive strategy. Remember, the only reason a company does managerial accounting is to satisfy a competitive need."

Using mathematics, they turn the intuition into a quantitative trading model for analysis, back testing and refinement. When the quantitative trading model proves to be likely profitable after passing the rigorous statistical tests, the traders implement the model on computer systems for automatic execution. In short, quantitative trading is the process where ideas are turned into mathematical models and then coded into computer programs for systematic trading. It is a science where mathematics and computer sciences meet. In this course, students study trading strategies from the popular literature and learn the fundamental mathematics and IT aspects of this emerging field. By working on the class projects, they will gain hands-on experience. After satisfactorily completing this course, the students will have the necessary quantitative, computing, and programming skills in quantitative trading. They are therefore well prepared for a front office trading role in hedge funds or banks."

            "DESCRIPTION": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz’s 1952 seminal paper “Portfolio Selection,” for which he would later receive the Nobel prize in 1990. He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and variations, namely, robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk (e.g., CVaR or ES), regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix via random matrix theory, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, mean models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on R programming. Each week will be devoted to a specific topic, during which the theory will be first presented, followed by an exposition of a practical implementation based on R programing."

High profile incidents such as the A380 engine explosion in Singapore in 2010, and Deepwater Horizon accident were caused by undetected cracks in either turbine blades or pressure vessels. The importance of NDE is clear as it can avoid these risks by finding a crack in time. NDE is one of the key elements to ensure the quality of manufacturing and evaluate whether it is still safe to use an aircraft engine after many years. This course will introduce the basic ingredients of NDE techniques. We will cover different NDE approaches, including visual, penetrant, eddy current, x-ray and ultrasound. We focus on ultrasonic NDE because it is the most widely used, and it is very popular in the aviation industry (e.g. HASEL, HAECO in HK and Rolls Royce in UK). For ultrasonic NDE, we will start from very basic acoustic/ultrasonic knowledge to practical inspection methods and more advanced techniques. The lectures will be associated with real industrial application examples from my personal consulting experiences in the aerospace and nuclear industry. In addition, a lab session will be organized to demonstrate the ultrasonic NDE technology to the students."

The first half of the course covers the period from 1858 to 1905 and focuses on the contribution of Japan’s indigenous market economy and state-building efforts to its transformation. In particular, we will examine how the western ideas of democracy and constitutionalism were introduced into Japan after 1858. In the second half of the course, we will focus on how political participation expanded in Japan after its victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. On the one hand, we will discuss how socio-economic development in post-1905 Japan contributed to the achievement of universal male suffrage and inspired Japanese women to demand similar political rights. On the other hand, we will examine the limitations of democratization in Japan before 1931. We will examine Japan’s domestic development against the international context and explore the reasons it moved to a trajectory of military power, invading neighboring Asian countries and ultimately entering into a total war with the US."

The same statement could be applied to China. Both countries, particularly Russia for the past 100 years, and China since 1949, have been little known, and less understood by outsiders, even scholars in their fields of Sinology and Russian affairs. Due to a lack of accessible sources, their foreign policies have been less understood, particularly their relations with each other. In this course we will examine the course of Russian and Chinese Relations from 1689 to the present, or some 330 years.  It is a relationship full of ups and downs. The two countries have shared the longest border in the world. The two countries have gone from alliances to battles. Lastly, we shall examine the state of Russian and Chinese Relations today, a state Russian scholars call a \"strategic partnership\", or even an alliance. We shall look at major issues that have drawn the two states together, and those that continue to divide the two powers. By the end of the course, students should have a balanced picture from Russian, Chinese and Western scholars of the course and development of Sino-Russian (Soviet) relations since 1689. We will try to reduce here the \"riddle wrapped up in a mystery inside an enigma\"."

Manager employee interactions have largely replaced comprehensive organizational career management systems as the primary building block of learning and professional growth. However, managers often lack the skills to build collaborative relationships that facilitate the learning, performance and development of their people. Manager's skill in empowering and coaching employees affects performance, morale and attrition. Approximately half the course will be an introduction to theories, models and tools of people development. The rest of the course will be devoted to learning and practicing applied coaching skills that students can take back to their jobs to enhance their individual growth and organizational success.

It comprises 2 parts: Part 1 aims to equip all full-time research postgraduate (RPg) students with basic teaching skills before assuming teaching assistant duties for the department. Good teaching skills can be acquired through learning and practice.  This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course. MPhil students are required to give at least one 30-minute session of instructional delivery in front of a group of students for one term. PhD students are required to give at least one such session each in two different terms. Graded PP, P or F."

The invention of nuclear weapons during World War II led Einstein to conclude that “the unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking.” Security concerns and government-sponsored research programs later combined to shape the Cold War arms race between the United States and Soviet Union. Many military and technical innovations resulted; these include precision-guided intercontinental ballistic missiles, spy satellites, and global navigation satellite systems, but also the modern electronic computer and computer networks, which became the basis for the internet. Recent developments in biotechnology and digital communication and control raise the prospect of possible new kinds of warfare. This course will provide students with a basic technical understanding of some of the critical technologies that are relevant to national and global security and will equip them with the skills to better assess the challenge of developing effective policies to manage such technologies.

            "DESCRIPTION": "The rapid economic modernization and building of a modern state in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 has long been considered a typical case of successful economic and political development. Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its \"learning from the west\". The lack of appreciation of Japan's indigenous resources of economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). Against this historical background, it emphasizes multiple possibilities in the political development of Japan after the Meiji Restoration, foreign aggression was by no means the only path of Japan's political development. Japan's indigenous development of market economy, state-building, and local representative assemblies contribute significantly to Japan's rapid rise as a regional power in 1905 and a world power after 1918. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan, provide them with the analytic skill and critical thinking over the issue of Japan's political and economic modernization. By highlighting the parallel processes of military development and the development of democracy in Japan between 1895 and 1931, this course will help the students to have a better understanding of the rise and collapse of democracy in pre-Japan. This course will help the students to view the relationship between Japan and China from a historical perspective.",

We will then discuss the methodological and analytical strategies of these two paradigms of ethnographic research. Next, we examine the logic of formulating research questions, sampling, casing, comparison, inter-subjectivity in interviews, concept formation, theoretical construction, ethical and political issues in doing ethnographic fieldwork. For those continuing with the second part of the course in the Spring Semester, we will work together on ethnographic projects related to public sociological issues in Hong Kong. Along with extended immersion in the field, we will learn to code, analyze, conceptualize and theorize from and with the data. The final product of the practicum is a paper that students can submit to professional journals for review and publication."

            "DESCRIPTION": "This course explores the statistical methods used for causal inference in the social sciences. Working within the potential outcomes framework, we discuss how the logic of inference for randomized experiments is the same as for non-randomized (observational) studies under certain additional assumptions. Though randomized experiments serve as the gold standard for causal inference, we note how it may sometimes be reasonable to treat non-experimental data as if it had been drawn from an experiment. Usually, this involves some knowledge about how the natural world produced the data through a quasi-random process. Research designs and methods covered include randomized experiments, matching, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs. In turn, we discuss how all of these methods require a unique set of assumptions to allow us to make valid casual inferences. Throughout the course we will draw examples from across the social sciences to illustrate the vast range of applications of these methods. Furthermore, the course will include computing sessions during which students are taught how to implement the techniques using modern statistical software."
